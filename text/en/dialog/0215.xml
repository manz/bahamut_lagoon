money or food for the dragons you
should go on a side quest.
You can fight a little bit and build up
strength before the real thing.

That's what that slow Heavy Armor
Knight Barclay said. He knows weird
things like that.[end]</data>

        <data>Anastasia: [character][0x0], did you know?
You can create dragons that use Holy
skills and ones that use Darkness skills!
Max out their fire, water, and thunder
elements, and then their heal or poison
attribute! And their attack or defense!
Barclay was saying that's how you do
it. If you do that, we wizards will
become even stronger.
And then Barclay and the others will
only play a supporting role![end]</data>
