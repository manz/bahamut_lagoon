        <data>Anastasia: Did you know, [character][0x0]?


They say that when dragons mature
they can become Master Dragons.

I heard that if you raise them until
they become adults they'll become
Master Dragons.
I heard so from Barclay.[end]</data>

        <data>Anastasia: Hey, [character][0x0], did you
know?

I heard this from Barclay, he said that
General Irvine of the Empire has
Excalibur.
Isn't that the legendary sword that
every knight wants?

But Barclay only has axes...[end]</data>

        <data>The other day, Matelite came by and
asked what armor was currently
popular.
When I answered him, he then asked
me what staffs were popular. There
aren't any popular staffs, I told him!
Then he asked what dresses were
popular. His face was bright red.

Does he have strange hobbies or
something, I wonder? What a weird
man![end]</data>
