        <data>Gunso: [0x2a]scratch[0x2a] There are some...
There are some, he said.

I want to return to Mahal very soon...
There are a lot of things I will do.

[0x2a]scratch[0x2a] The first thing I'll do is take
off this armor [0x2a]scratch[0x2a] and have a
nice bath... [0x2a]scratch[0x2a]
I will feel completely refreshed.

        <data>Gunso: Mahal has been revived,
[0x2a]scratch[0x2a] and now I must make sure I
don't die.
[0x2a]scratch[0x2a] No, no... I'm not neglecting it.


[0x2a]scratch[0x2a] I must help Taicho return
Mahal to its former glory. [0x2a]scratch[0x2a]
That's why I must live...[end]Y</data>

Stab-stab!

I secretly switched Reeve's spear with
an especially heavy one.

It feels good, he deserves it for
betraying our friendship.[end]F</data>

Keep up the good work!!

I guess I'm better suited at this than
being a Lancer.

I'll probably be a cleaning boy like this
for a very long time.[end]Z</data>
