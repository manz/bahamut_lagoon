From now on we'll work hard and

Me and Rush and the others were
failures of Kahna until you asked us
for our help.
We slept like stray dogs beneath
bridges or in the corner of the castle
grounds. I don't like that...
This ship is fun, but... I want a house
that I can live in with Rush and Truce.
That's why I want your help.
Also... keep this a secret from Rush

Anyway, using magic to attack from far

It's best to attack head on into intense
battles! Fighting face-to-face is better
than fighting from far away.
What's better, you ask?
