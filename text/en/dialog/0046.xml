         The beginning of it all
       was a very long time ago...

              Our hatred...
        Our sadness... Our anger...

     The War of the Holy Dragons...[end] </data>

                  Listen...

              Very long ago...
         we Holy Dragons fought.

             We felt hatred...
            we were twisted...
            we were cursed...
 All of the emptiness there was lost...
   All that remained was our minds...
   The minds of we Holy Dragons...

        The door to the new era...
             When it is opened...

         We shall be despised.


      That time is soon at hand...[end][end]</data>
